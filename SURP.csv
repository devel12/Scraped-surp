What characterizes crystalline materials is the orderly arrangement of atoms, called a crystal structure. What is surprising, and interesting, is that crystalline materials are rarely perfect. They are full of various kinds of defects like vacancies, dislocations, grain boundaries, etc. It turns out that these defects are central to how these materials behave, and controlling these defects is a central focus of modern materials engineering. In this project, you will develop an ML classifier to differentiate between different kinds of crystal structures and defects contained in them. The project is computational in nature and will involve working with datasets involving coordinates of atoms in various configurations.","You will learn a lot of cool concepts related to the physics of crystalline defects, and different ways of classifying and visualizing them.

2110,Grid movement methods for fluid-solid interactions,Professor J. C. Mandal,mandal@aero.iitb.ac.in,"The numerical simulation of unsteady fluid flow over moving bodies often requires to deal with large deformation of the computational domain and, at the same time, to precisely represent the boundaries or the interfaces of multi-material systems. The abilities to deal with both the requirements is determined by the choice of the kinematic description, which expresses the relationship between the deforming continuum and the computational grid. This is achieved within the framework of the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method. In this framework, the grid is neither fixed in space nor attached to the material particle but it moves independently so as to follow the domain boundary or interfaces while maintaining good quality computational mesh. The governing equations are formulated over the deforming control volumes. Thus, it is possible to accurately track the boundaries or interfaces as well as easily deal with the distortions of the continuum domain with the ALE method.
One of the challenges in ALE method is to develop grid movement strategy so that quality of the computational grid is maintained at every instant of time in order to avoid excessive truncation error. In the proposed project, one is expected to look at the available grid movement algorithms and develop codes. Based on the computational evaluation of the grid movement algorithms, one should come up with a recommendation and improvement in the algorithm(s), if possible.

2111,Semi-analytic methods for solving fluid flow problems,Professor J. C. Mandal,mandal@aero.iitb.ac.in,"Conventional analytical methods, for solving nonlinear differential equations governing fluid flows, change the original problems in some ways (like introducing linearization, perturbation) in order to make them mathematically tractable. Unfortunately, these changes necessarily alter the solutions, which may lead to serious deviation in the physical behavior. Even linear differential equations may not always be amenable to analytical solution for certain type of boundary conditions. In a similar way, numerical solutions of the differential equations also suffer from errors arising out of the approximations involved in the discretization process. Moreover, numerical computations may be exorbitantly costly at times. Therefore, semi-analytic methods are developed with an aim to avoid these limitations so that physically correct solution can be obtained with minimal effort.

In the proposed project, one is expected to learn semi-analytic techniques like Adomian Decomposition Method and apply them to selected fluid flow equations. It is expected that you should be motivated enough to learn new things with little help from supervisor.

Although there have been specific investigations into certain accidents by various agencies yet a central, publicly accessible, online database or up-to-date summary is lacking. The goal of this project is to work at creating such a database and then to derive more insights into the data by way of analytics.

The students will start on the basis of some previous work by another group of students which has created the skeleton of an online database of incidents drawn primarily from news media reports. This project will improve this user interface e.g. add more search possibilities, filters etc. and then also try to connect this incident database with links to official investigation reports of various governmental agencies. A map-based representation of the dataset is also desirable.

Further work will involve drawing statistical insights from this dataset including analysis of the accident frequency, types of accidents, geographical spread, variation in economic damage and casualties etc. Text based data mining (Machine Learning) can be used to analyse media reports for particular keywords to further classify these incidents. We would also like to know what percent of reported accidents have publicly accessible accident reports from which other industries can learn and improve their operations. Ultimately, it would be good if we could also develop a initial machine based system that can crawl media reports and automatically identify accident reports from news reports so that a hybrid (ML + human vetting) time-evolving accident database can be developed.

Ideally the work should lead to a visually pleasing, easy to use, online database as well as a derived publication.

Phuleria,phuleria@iitb.ac.in,"This study aims to examine the impact of traffic characteristics on vehicular emissions under real-world driving conditions, in particular the impact of high emitting vehicles, or “super emitters”. Super emitters can be old vehicles (sometimes new vehicles too) and overloaded vehicles that are responsible for 30-50% of total on-road emissions. Due to poor maintenance, over-fueling, faulty air filters and engines, they emit visible plume of black smoke. Similarly, the over-loaded vehicles cause excessive engine temperature leading to high pollutant emissions as well. Though their share in the total vehicular fleet is usually small, the super emitters can disproportionately affect the total fleet emissions. In this regard, two field sampling campaigns were conducted at Kamshet-I roadway tunnel (with 80% light duty vehicles and 20% heavy-duty vehicles) on Mumbai-Pune Expressway and Eastern Freeway tunnel (with 98% Light-duty vehicles) in Mumbai. Comprehensive traffic characterization is being carried out for these study locations to understand the urban vs. highway on-road emissions. Student will need to work on about 20 hours of traffic video data to identify the fleet composition and the super-emitters. This data will need to be combined with vehicle registration data from about 600 vehicles.

2159,Developing a responsive/intelligent system for helping students manage uncertainty and solve complex problems,Professor Chandan Dasgupta,cdasgupta@iitb.ac.in,"The goal of this project is to develop a responsive system that helps middle school students understand complex engineering problems, process the uncertainties inherent to the problem, simulate possible solutions, and take optimal decisions by working collaboratively and seeking relevant feedback from peers and online resources. We intend to capture problem-solvers' strategies that they use to manage uncertainties and the heuristics that they apply to optimize the resources at hand.
For this internship, the goal is to develop a number of responsive/intelligent simulations that help students experience uncertainty and practice optimal decision-making while learning science and engineering practices. Some possible simulations that are likely to be developed during this internship are as follows.

1. MUST: Management of Uncertainty in a Suboptimal design problem about navigating in Traffic. The MUST interface will be designed to present a real-life traffic scenario, where middle school students will have to make a series of decisions that will let them reach a particular target destination from a given initial state. The task will feature a set of conceptual constraints, like maintaining a specific speed, minimizing the distance covered, minimizing the time taken, or practical constraints, like vehicle picked, traffic signal, uneven terrain, and reduced fuel. These constraint variables will be weaved into the interface such that that at a given time (t) only one combination of them could be altered, keeping the rest fixed. Once the destination is reached, students will be given the next task to re-visit their path taken and to try to optimize the resources used for the constraints they had worked with. Students' designs will be scored based on an optimized standard pre-designed navigation path. The backend of the MUST interface will log all the moves that students make on the screen. The two navigation tasks will be sandwiched between two online tests, a pre-test and a post-test, to determine students' conceptual and practical understanding about the dynamics of traffic navigation as well as knowledge of engineering practices.

2. Designing Wheels for a Planetary Rover: This scenario focuses on helping students understand why we need different kinds of wheels for planetary rovers (e.g., Mars Rover) and how to design such wheels. No one really thinks about wheels and their applications since the wheel has remained more or less the same for the past millennium. As humanity progresses and wishes to attain higher speeds on earth as well as on other planets, it’s impossible not to look at the wheel and see how we can improve it to do much more than just roll. A planetary rover’s wheels are part of a complex integrated system that must work reliably and optimally under harsh conditions. The simulation will help students work collaboratively and design rover wheels that satisfy some key requirements such as need to be compliant, lightweight, ability to carry high loads, durable, ability to regain shape on deformation, ability to protect wheel hub assembly from projectiles, and ability to work reasonably well in most types of soil consistencies. Similar to the previous scenario, the interface needs to capture students’ actions and save their work.

Inhomogeneities, if present in the dielectric materials, lead to multiple relaxation times. The shunt elements in the circuit represent different relaxation times at different locations. There will be changes in the model according to the conditions such as moisture ingress, voids/cracks in the insulation, etc. Insulation resistance (IR) is assumed to be a characteristic that is sensitive to the presence of cracks/voids or other impurities in the material.

classical Hall effect which leads to a Hall voltage in the perpendicular
direction to the Electric field established by the battery in the sample
driven by classical Lorentz forces. In the quantum domain, entirely new
physics emerges where the effects of topology were first felt in
electronic systems historically speaking. Presently, such lines of
research are being pursued vigorously from different angles including
field theories.

understanding of these effects both when electron interactions can be

In broad strokes, the idea is to solve min_x max_y f(x, y) for x and y belonging to given sets X and Y, respectively, and f is a reasonably “nice” function. The variable y takes is regarded as the uncertainty, and typically the set Y is ‘large’. This minmax problem is difficult to solve in general, so one ‘samples’ the set Y m times and solves min_x max_{i=1, …, m} f(x, y_i) instead. The key issue is the closeness of the values of the original and sampled problems. Several probabilistic bounds have appeared in the literature that point out several attractive features of the technique. If Y is high-dimensional, however, matters are complicated by the so-called concentration phenomenon. This project will focus on the behavior of the scenario approach to robust optimization in the moderate through high dimensional regime.
